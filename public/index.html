            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the App, such as channels watched, features accessed, duration of use, crash reports, and interaction with advertisements. This data is primarily collected in an aggregated and anonymized form where possible, **but may also be analyzed in more detail to personalize in-app content and experiences.**</li>
            <li><strong>Log Data:</strong> Information that your device sends whenever you visit our App, suchs as access times and dates, and other statistics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>The information we collect is used for the following purposes:</p>

            <li>To provide personalized content and recommendations within the App, **including tailoring content and features based on your past interactions within the app and any preferences you explicitly set.**</li>
            <li>To display relevant advertisements, as described in Section 3 (Third-Party Service Providers).</li>
            <li>To communicate with you, **including responding to your inquiries and, if you have opted in, sending you updates or newsletters related to the App.**</li>
            <li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms of service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
        <p>We use third-party services in the App for analytics and advertising. These providers may collect, use, and share your information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to understand their data practices.</p>

        <h3>a. Advertising (Google AdMob, AppLovin, etc.):</h3>
        <p>We use advertising services like Google AdMob and AppLovin to serve advertisements within our App. These providers may collect and use your device identifier (e.g., Advertising ID) and other information about your interests and app usage to provide personalized ads. This helps us to offer the App for free.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> For more information on how Google uses data, please visit Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a> and how Google uses information from apps or sites that use their services: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>AppLovin:</strong> For more information on AppLovin's privacy practices, please visit their Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.applovin.com/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.applovin.com/privacy/</a>.</li>
            <li>You can typically reset your device's advertising ID in your device settings, which may limit the collection of personalized data. You may also be able to opt-out of personalized advertising through your device settings (e.g., Android: Google Settings > Ads; iOS: Settings > Privacy > Apple Advertising).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>b. Analytics (Firebase, Google Analytics):</h3>
        <p>We use Firebase and Google Analytics for aggregated analytics regarding app usage. These tools help us understand how users interact with our App, identify trends, and improve features. Firebase may collect data like crash reporting, performance monitoring, and analytics events. This data is generally anonymized and aggregated, **but may also be used to understand user behavior for content and experience personalization.**</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> For more information on Firebase's data processing, please visit Google's Firebase Privacy and Security page: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>.</li>
